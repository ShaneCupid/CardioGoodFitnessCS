# CardioGood Fitness Data Analysis
by: Shane C.

## Overview
This repository hosts the 'CardioGood Fitness Data Analysis' project, focusing on understanding customer profiles for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The analysis uses data collected over the past three months from individuals who purchased treadmills in CardioGood Fitness retail stores. The dataset, `CardioGoodFitness.csv`, contains demographic and treadmill usage information of the customers.

## Technologies Used
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Description
The goal of this project is to perform descriptive analytics to create detailed customer profiles for each of CardioGood Fitness' treadmill product lines (TM195, TM498, TM798). The project involves:

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Statistical analysis to understand customer demographics and usage patterns.
- Identification of trends and insights related to treadmill product preferences.

### Notebook_CardioGood_Fitness_Data_Analysis.ipynb
- **Input**: `CardioGoodFitness.csv` file containing customer demographics and treadmill usage data.
- **Process**: 
  - Data loading and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory data analysis including histograms and boxplots.
  - Detailed customer profiling based on product usage, demographics, and fitness levels.
- **Output**: Visualizations and insights about customer profiles for each treadmill product.

## How It Works

### Data Preparation and Exploration
- Loading and exploring the dataset using Pandas.
- Generating histograms and boxplots to understand distributions and relationships in the data.
- Using Seaborn for advanced visualizations.

### Customer Profiling
- Analyzing the data to identify typical customer profiles for each treadmill model.
- Investigating differences in demographics such as age, gender, education, marital status, income, and fitness level.

### Insights and Analysis
- Drawing insights from statistical data and visualizations.
- Understanding the correlation between product choice and customer characteristics.
